# Next with Geist

This example uses <a href="https://github.com/geist-org/react">geist ui<a/>. The example for this comes from <a href="https://github.com/geist-org/react/tree/master/examples/create-next-app">here</a> I have changed some stuff like added typescript and made this a standalone repo.

## Directions

```shell
git clone https://github.com/arnavg115/next-geist-typescript.git
cd next-geist-typescript
npm install
npm run dev
```
